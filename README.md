# PLUGIN: HTML Size Charts for WooCommerce

Adds ability to add custom size chart to each product if required.

To use size chart directly in product description please use [sbhtml_size_chart] in description TEXT editor, not visual editor.

Also has action hook [mwc_size_chart] to add size chart to any page, provided a suitable product ID is passed.

Action is used specifically in Multi Woo Checkout as well.

NOTE: this is a bespoke plugin created for a client, so will likely require mods to work for your use case.
